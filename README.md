# Thesis

## Aim:
The aim of this repository is to house all my progress towards my Thesis.

The thesis has developed to a mainly focused - Object Detection Application that will aid it's users throughout their daily food intake by aiming to simplify the process of food tracking. Will be a hybrid application so the user can use it from any device.

## Current Experimentation:
Testing Supervised vs Un-Supervised Learning

## Notes:
###### Object Detection Agents Possible:
Tensorflow Lite,
YOLO-Tiny

###### Object Detection Being Used:
YOLOv7 - Supervised Learning
Tensorflow - Un-Supervised Learning

###### Object Detection Agent for App:
Tensorflow.js

###### App Framework:
React.js
