# Thesis

## Aim:
The aim of this repository is to house all my progress towards my Thesis.
The Thesis is an Object-Detection & Augmented Reality based application that will aid it's users throughout their daily food intake.
Very Important that it needs to be a developed Phone Application.

## Current Experimentation:
Currently Following a Tensorflow Object Detection Tutorial (Tensorflow Lite can be used to develop phone applications (Since I am working on IOS this
will work through Swift))

## Notes:
###### Object Detection Agents Possible:
Tensorflow Lite,
YOLO-Tiny

###### Programs That Might Be Used:
OpenSpace3D,
Unity,
XCode

###### Languages That Might Be Used:
Python,
C#

## Blockers:
Hit an "error" in the tutorial, the test and train files are not being generated, hence cant continue forward, and also tensorflow is taking a lot of time to import at the moment.
Moving forward, I am currently finding either a different tutorial/solution
