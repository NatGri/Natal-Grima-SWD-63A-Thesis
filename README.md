# Thesis

## Aim:
The aim of this repository is to house all my progress towards my Thesis.

The thesis has developed to a mainly focused - Object Detection Application that will aid it's users throughout their daily food intake by aiming to simplify the process of food tracking. Will be a hybrid application so the user can use it from any device.

## Current Experimentation:
Finalising Prototype

## Notes:
###### Object Detection Agent:
Tensorflow Lite

###### Object Detection Being Used:
Tensorflow - Un-Supervised Learning

###### App Framework:
Python Application

###### Limitation:
Hybrid application approach proved to be difficult to implement, thus, based on mentor guidance I am now opting a Python Application that is ran through my Laptop as a final Prototype.
